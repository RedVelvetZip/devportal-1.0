## RSKIP - Rootstock Improvement Proposals

The Rootstock roadmap has been established by the Rootstock community. During the first years of Rootstock development, RootstockLabs, now [RootstockLabs](https://rootstocklabs.com) had an active role building the reference implementation. After RSK was launched, RootstockLabs continued to be highly involved with the community by improving the codebase and proposing improvements through the RSKIP proposal repository system. The repository helps the community members to coordinate discussions, rejection, acceptance and deployment over multiple codebases.
