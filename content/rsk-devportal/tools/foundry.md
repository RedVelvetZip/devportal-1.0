[Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh) is a smart contract development toolchain, and user-friendly development environment for writing and testing smart contracts in Solidity. It manages dependencies, compiles, run tests, deploy contracts and allows for interaction with EVM-compatible chains using a command-line tool called [Forge](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/). 

In this guide, we will learn about Foundry and its benefits for smart contract development, how to setup your environment, create a Foundry project and execute a deployment script.

## Why use Foundry?

Forge is ideal for advanced smart contract analysis, auditing, and for fast execution of smart contract tests. 

> Note: Use the [hardhat-foundry plugin](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-foundry) to have your Foundry project work alongside Hardhat. 

Here are some reason why you may prefer Foundry:

1. Local Networks: 
It provides a local blockchain environment using the [anvil tool](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/anvil/), allowing developers to deploy contracts, run tests, and debug code. It can also be used to fork other EVM compatible networks.
 
2. Advanced Testing: 
[Forge](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/advanced-testing) comes with a number of advanced testing methods including:
   - Fuzz testing
   - Invariant testing
   - Differential testing
   - Symbolic Execution
   - Mutation Testing

3. Advanced Debugging: 
[Forge](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/debugger) allows for advanced debugging using an interactive debugger. 

The debugger terminal is divided into four quadrants:

[](#top "collapsible")
- Quadrant 1
   - The opcodes in the debugging session, with the current opcode highlighted. Additionally, the address of the current account, the program counter and the accumulated gas usage is also displayed.
- Quadrant 2
   - The current stack, as well as the size of the stack
- Quadrant 3
   - The source view.
- Quadrant 4
   - The current memory of the EVM.
 
   
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To get started with Foundry, ensure the following tools are installed:
- The [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) Compiler
- Cargo Package Manager

> For an easy installation of the above tools, use the [rustup installer](https://rustup.rs).

### Installation

To install, use Foundryup. Foundryup is the Foundry toolchain installer. You can find more information in the [Foundry README](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/blob/master/foundryup/README.md).

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Running foundryup by itself will install the latest (nightly) precompiled binaries: `forge`, `cast`, `anvil`, and `chisel`.

> Visit the [installation guides](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) for more information.

### Create a foundry project

To start a new project with Foundry, use [forge init](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-init.html).

```bash
forge init hello_foundry
```

> See more details on how to [create a new project](https://book.getfoundry.sh/projects/creating-a-new-project) using the Foundry guide.

### Write your first contract

Let’s view the file structure for a default foundry project:

```bash
$ cd hello_foundry
$ tree . -d -L 1
.
├── lib
├── script
├── src
└── test

4 directories
```

The `src` directory contains counter smart contract with test written in the `test` directory. Now, let's build the foundry project.

```bash
forge build
```

And then run tests.

```bash
forge test
```

### Deploy contract on the Rootstock

To deploy the counter contract on Rootstock mainnet or testnet, further configure Foundry by setting up a Rootstock RPC url and a private key of an account that’s funded with tRBTC. 

#### Environment Configuration

Once you have an account with a private key, create a `.env` file in the root of the foundry project and add the variables. 

Foundry automatically loads a `.env` file present in the project directory.

The `.env` file should follow this format:

```bash
ROOTSTOCK_RPC_URL=https://public-node.testnet.rsk.co
PRIVATE_KEY=0x...
```

At the root of the project, run:

```bash
# To load the variables in the .env file
source .env
```

#### Modify Deployment Script

Modify the deployment counter deploy script in the `scripts` directory to use the private key by modifying the run method, see below example:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import {Script, console} from "forge-std/Script.sol";

import "../src/Counter.sol";


contract CounterScript is Script {
    function setUp() public {}

    function run() public {
        vm.startBroadcast(vm.envUint("PRIVATE_KEY"));

        new Counter();

        vm.stopBroadcast();

    }
}

```

By default, scripts are executed by calling the function named `run` at the entrypoint.

```solidity
uint256 deployerPrivateKey = vm.envUint("PRIVATE_KEY");
```

> - CAUTION: Be cautious when exposing private keys in a `.env` file and loading them into programs. 
   > - This is only recommended for use with non-privileged deployers or for local / test setups.

When calling `vm.startBroadcast()`, the contract creation will be recorded by Forge, and we can broadcast the transaction to deploy the contract on-chain.

#### Execute the deployment script

We will use Forge to run our script and broadcast the transactions - this can take a little while, since Forge also waits for the transaction receipts. 

```bash
forge script script/Counter.s.sol --rpc-url $ROOTSTOCK_RPC_URL --broadcast --legacy
```

[](#top "collapsible")
- Note:
   - [EIP-1559](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md) is not supported or not activated on the Rootstock RPC url
   - The `--legacy` flag is passed to use legacy transactions instead of `EIP-1559`.

The result should look like this:

```bash
[⠰] Compiling...
No files changed, compilation skipped
Script ran successfully.
