[GiveTrack](https://www.givetrack.org/) leverages Bitcoin and Blockchain technology to fund global projects with high **environmental** and **public health** impact using a radically transparent donation platform.

GiveTrack is a platform nonprofits use to collect donations, and share updates with owners about how their contributions are used. This ties donations directly to project results. GiveTrack offers **unprecedented transparency** in the philantrophic process, giving donors the ability to transfer, track, and provide a permanent record of the global financial transactions, tracked from from inception to completion. Individual donors can view and verify direct evidence-based outcomes for their donations, encouraging them to give more.
