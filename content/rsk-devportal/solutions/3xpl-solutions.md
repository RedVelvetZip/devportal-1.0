3xpl (short for 3xplor3r) is a super-fast ad-free universal explorer for 40+ most popular public blockchains. It offers an easy-to-understand block explorer interface for ordinary crypto users that also lets you obtain PDF transaction receipts and wallet statements. Rootstock ERC-20, 721, 1155, and .rsk names are also supported.
For power users, developers, analysts, and academia, 3xpl has even more: JSON and WebSocket API to build apps, ClickHouse API to run analytical SQL queries, and downloadable database dumps to work with blockchain data locally.

## About 3xpl

Most explorers support 3-4 blockchains at most or a single architecture. 3xpl aims to support as many blockchains as possible under a single interface and data format. This allows users to find their addresses and transactions without switching contexts. The universal search bar allows you to search all blockchains at once.
One of the distinctive advantages of 3xpl over other explorers is that its core is open-source. Being open-source means that 3xpl’s data is verifiable: anyone can run 3xpl’s code and get the same block data as displayed on Explorers. It also allows 3xpl to grow faster and develop its explorers more efficiently as open code allows receiving input from crypto communities.

## Privacy First

Block explorers and their advertising partners tend to track users to maximize their profits. When an ad network or Google Analytics is used, explorers leak which users see which transactions, thus making it possible to connect users with their transactions and wallet balances.
3xpl takes privacy seriously and has no 3rd party code on its pages. 3xpl offers an Onion hidden service on the Tor network for maximum privacy. 3xpl can work without JavaScript being enabled.
