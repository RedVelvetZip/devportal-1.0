### AMLT Oracle

The AMLT Oracle offers both a partial and fully decentralized solution to proactively manage compliance risks and comply with regulations.

DeFi platforms and DEXes benefit from the AMLT Oracle,
when users interact with a decentralized finance provider,
their wallet address is queried for risk through the AMLT Oracle,
which in turn passes data from Coinfirm’s API to generate a report ID C-Score
based on 300+ risk evaluation scenarios,
and subsequently relays the information to the DEX.
