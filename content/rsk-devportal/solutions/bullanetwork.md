## About Bulla Network

Bulla Network uses a first-ever protocol that allows users to send NFT invoices using its BullaBanker app. BullaBanker mints a non-fungible accounting journal token (NFAJT) when users send an invoice to someone on the blockchain. The platform automatically recognizes when an invoice has been paid, providing an on-chain accounting tool with an easy to use interface.

BullaBanker allows users to send invoices on the blockchain, essentially tokenizing debt as an NFT. It doesn’t mean that the particular NFT is worth a certain amount, but it represents an understanding or contract between a service provider and a client.

Anyone can use BullaBanker, all they need is a Metamask wallet connected to the Rootstock mainnet. The system allows users to add attachments on IPFS, for example, the invoice itself as a PDF. BullaBanker also allows users to tag transactions, creating ways to sort and categorize invoices.

### Components of Bulla Banker
