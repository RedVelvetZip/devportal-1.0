In this section, we will cover the difference between a stablecoin and other digital assets like bitcoins, fiat currency, fungible tokens, Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDCs), and Altcoins.

## Stablecoin vs Bitcoins

A stablecoin is a token that has a non-volatile price and Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency whose price is volatile in nature. Stablecoins are used  to minimize the price volatility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoins.

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Stablecoins</th>
    <th>Bitcoins</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Regulated</td>
    <td>Non-regulated</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Non-volatile</td>
    <td>Volatile</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Used as an alternative to fiat currencies</td>
    <td>Used for trading on exchanges</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Means of payment</td>
    <td>Means of payment</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Stablecoin vs Altcoin

Altcoins are cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. Similar comparisons apply, with regards to volatility.

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Stablecoins</th>
    <th>Altcoins</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>A token built on a blockchain network backed by fiat and cryptocurrency</td>
    <td>Any cryptocurrency other than bitcoin are known as altcoin</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Token</td>
    <td>Cryptocurrency</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Stable</td>
    <td>Volatile</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fiat-collateralized, crypto-collateralized, commodity-collateralized, non-collateralized</td>
    <td>Rootstock, Ethereum</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Stablecoin vs Fiat

Stablecoins are issued by crypto companies that are backed by traditional financial investment tools. They can be pegged to any fiat currency, foreign exchange-traded commodities, precious or industrial metals.

While fiat currencies are issued by central banks, they are not asset-backed. Their value depends on the central bank. The central bank can regulate the total supply in circulation by printing and withdrawing them from use.

## Stablecoin vs Fungible Tokens

A stablecoin is a type of fungible token whose value is fixed to another asset, often currencies such as the US dollar or the Euro, and other assets.

## Stablecoin vs CBDCs

A stablecoin may or may not be regulated, while Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is completely regulated by the monetary authorities of a nation. This means stablecoins are decentralized while CBDCs are centralized. Furthermore, CBDCs may be implemented with fungible tokens, in a manner similar to stablecoins, or they may be implemented using other technologies, including centralised ones.

<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Decentralized</td>
    <td>Centralized</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Used as an alternative to fiat currencies</td>
    <td>Used as a means of payment like the country's fiat currency</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cryptocurrency</td>
    <td>Cryptocurrency</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Uses private money</td>
    <td>CBDCs use private money but guarded by reserve assets of the country</td>
  </tr>
