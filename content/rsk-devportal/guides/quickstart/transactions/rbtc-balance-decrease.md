You may have noticed that when you sent tRBTC, the tRBTC balance decreased by **slightly more** than the amount that you sent. You may also have noticed that when you sent tRIF, the tRBTC balance also decreased by a small amount, even though only tRIF were sent in that transaction.

You would have seen this in the transaction confirmation screens when you confirmed each transaction.

This is **not an error**, it is simply a fundamental aspect of how blockchain networks function - any time you add a transaction to the blockchain, you must pay the network a fee to compensate them for their computational costs.
