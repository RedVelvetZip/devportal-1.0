As Rootstock is a blockchain with smart contract capabilities, it is possible to build decentralised applications (dApps) with it.
Most dApps are web applications that you access with a regular Internet browser, such as Chrome.
However, the blockchain interactions require some additional software, which comes in the form of browser extensions.
These browser extensions insert a **web3 provider** object, with the Javascript parts of the web application used to interact with the blockchain, forming an integral part of dApp architecture.

> Note that these browser extensions store your private keys,
> and use them to sign transactions. So keep them secure.

There are currently two well known browser extensions that you can use to interact with the Rootstock blockchain: [MetaMask](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn), and [Liquality](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/liquality-wallet/kpfopkelmapcoipemfendmdcghnegimn).
Since this is a quick start, we will not go through all of them - just MetaMask.

There are some hidden complexity that we've glossed over in the content above so
you can set up and get running as quickly as possible.
