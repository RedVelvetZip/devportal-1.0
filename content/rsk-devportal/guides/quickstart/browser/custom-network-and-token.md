## Configure custom network for Rootstock Testnet

MetaMask comes pre-configured with connections for Ethereum networks.
Let’s use its custom networks feature to add a connection to an Rootstock network.

After creating the custom network for the Rootstock Testnet, you should be able to interact with smart contracts deployed on the Rootstock Testnet!
You should also see your balances in tRBTC (Testnet RBTC).
This is currently zero, which means that we cannot send any transactions to the blockchain, so let’s get some using the RBTC faucet.

Now you should have a balance of tRBTC, and you will be able to send transactions on the Rootstock Testnet!

## Configure Custom Token for tRIF

The Rootstock Infrastructure Framework (RIF) includes multiple services for decentralised applications.
These services may be paid for using the RIF token.
Let’s configure MetaMask to be aware of the RIF token.
We’ll use tRIF as the token symbol, since we’re on the Rootstock Testnet.

Now that MetaMask has the RIF token configured, let’s get some test tokens using the RIF faucet.

</div>

Now you should have a balance of tRIF, and you will be able to use RIF services on the Rootstock Testnet!
