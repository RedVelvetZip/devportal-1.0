Cryptocurrency exchanges present users with a list of currency pairs, essentially individual markets where users can trade one digital asset for another. The price of each pair, reflecting the value of one currency in terms of the other, is typically determined by market forces like supply and demand. However, the exchange itself might set the price in some instances, particularly for stablecoins (tokens pegged to a fiat currency) or inter-pegged cryptocurrencies.

When trading on an exchange, remember that they typically charge fees for each trade and potentially for depositing or withdrawing funds from your personal/custodian accounts.

## Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges

One of the ways to get RBTC is to use the services of centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. These are companies who provide a service which allows its users to trade between one cryptocurrency and another cryptocurrency, or a fiat currency and a cryptocurrency. These exchanges hold assets on your behalf - which means that in the case of cryptocurrencies, they operate crypto wallets on your behalf.

The way that exchanges work will be quite familiar if you have traded on a stock exchange or a foreign currency exchange before. They typically have order books to match buy and sell orders among different users, with the price of a particular pair being the last match in the order book.

## Sending and Receiving RBTC

[RBTC is the built-in cryptocurrency of the Rootstock network](https://developers.rsk.co/kb/get-crypto-on-rsk/cryptocurrency-vs-token/). This means that (1) you should have a wallet that is configured to work with the Rootstock network, and (2) that wallet must have some RBTC if you wish to send transactions.

> Warning: A common mistake users make when interacting with exchanges is that they **confuse** Rootstock addresses/ wallets with Ethereum addresses/ wallets. Their addresses follow the same format, but they are otherwise incompatible. **Do not** send RBTC to an Ethereum address on an exchange. Similarly, **do not** send Ether to an RBTC address on an exchange. Your funds will be burnt (permanently lost) should you do so, as blockchain transactions are immutable, and therefore cannot be undone. It is **your own responsibility** to ensure that you are using the right wallet, and connected to the right network. RBTC can **only** be sent to and from Rootstock addresses on the Rootstock network.
