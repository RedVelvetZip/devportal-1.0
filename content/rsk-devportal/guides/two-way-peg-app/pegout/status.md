The processing of a pegout transaction is made up of several dependencies, and for each dependency a processing step is added, and at each step in the process, the pegout is shown in a form on the transaction status query screen.

After finish a pegout you can search for the current status in the [status page](https://app.2wp.rootstock.io/status)

Just after finish a pegout transaction, this transaction is not mined in the Rootstock network yet, this status will be showed in the transaction status page:
