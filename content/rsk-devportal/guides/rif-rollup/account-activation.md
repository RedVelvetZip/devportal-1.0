The first transaction on L2 after depositing or funding your account requires a separate action for account activation. For more information about account activation, see [Account Activation FAQ](/rif/rollup/faqs/).

1. When transferring funds on RIF Rollup (L2), you will be prompted to "Authorize to Sign account activation" and need to sign the message first to generate your rollup L2 private key.
