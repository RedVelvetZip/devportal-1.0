## Instantiate the lib with your local blockchain

The library has already set the contract addresses for Rootstock (RSK) Mainnet and Testnet, so if the Web3 instance points to one of those networks, no extra action is needed.
If you want to use your local blockchain, contract addresses must be provided and should be sent as parameter.

> If a custom blockchain has been set but the contracts addresses are not provided, it will throw [“No contract addresses provided”](/rif/rns/libs/javascript/Errors/) on the first operation invoked.

**Example**
```javascript
async function myCustomGetOwner(domain) {
  const web3 = new Web3('http://localhost:7545');

  const options = {
    contractAddresses: {
      registry: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000123456789'
    }
  };

  const rns = new RNS(web3, options);

  const address = await rns.addr('testing.rsk');
}
```

You can also specify a different `networkId` to perform checksum validations according to
[EIP-1191](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1191),
it should be added in the `options` parameter.
If the `networkId` is not provided, and the current blockchain is not Rootstock (RSK) Mainnet or Rootstock (RSK) Testnet, the library will validate addresses without taking in consideration the `networkId`, as explained in
[EIP-55](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-55).

**Example**
```javascript
async function myCustomGetOwner(domain) {
  const web3 = new Web3('https://rpc.testnet.rootstock.io/API_KEY') // or 'https://rpc.rootstock.io/';

  const options = {
    contractAddresses: {
      registry: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000123456789'
    },
    networkId: 32,
  };

  const rns = new RNS(web3, options);

  const address = await rns.addr('testing.rsk');
}
```

> Replace `"API_KEY"` with the api key that you have created for this App. For information on how to create an api key, see [How to get started with RPC API](/tools/rpc-api/).

## Advanced usage

Use Web3 `Contract`s directly

The library must be composed before accessing to the contracts, if not, it will throw [“Library not composed”](/rif/rns/libs/javascript/Errors).

```javascript
async function myCustomGetOwner(domain) {
  const web3 = new Web3('https://rpc.testnet.rootstock.io/API_KEY') // or 'https://rpc.rootstock.io/'
  const rns = new RNS(web3)
  await rns.compose()

  const owner = await rns.contracts.registry.methods.owner(domain).call()
  return owner;
}
```
