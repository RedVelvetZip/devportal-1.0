RIF Rollup is a trustless protocol for **fast and scalable low-cost** payments on Rootstock powered by zkRollup Technology.  It is a fork of the Zero Knowledge zkSync Lite (v1) developed by [Matter Labs](https://matter-labs.io/). Its current functionality and scope includes low gas transfers of RBTC and ERC20 tokens on the Rootstock network.

> Disclaimer: The RIF Rollup is ONLY available on Testnet at this time.

## Use Cases

RIF Rollup can be used for the following purposes:

* **Payments:** RIF Rollup provides numerous benefits to businesses and developers that want to build a secure and trust-minimized scalable payment solution. 
* **Non-fungible tokens (NFTs):** Rollups can be used to improve the scalability of NFT marketplaces and other NFT applications.

## Credits

The zkSync platform, a Zero-knowledge Rollup implementation was created by [Matter Labs - Creators of zkSync](https://matter-labs.io/) in 2020 to improve Ethereum scaling. The RIF Rollup Codebase, Javascript SDKs, and Rollup Tools like the RIF Rollup Wallet and RIF Rollup Explorer were forked from the zkSync Lite platform by [Matter Labs](https://matter-labs.io/).
