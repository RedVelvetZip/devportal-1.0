The RIF Name Service provides unique names for your wallet addresses to seamlessly receive crypto assets.Registering a username makes it easy to send and receive funds on the RIF Wallet App. After a username has been registered, you would be able to receive tokens on exchanges and wallets that support the Rootstock network using an email address. See the [RNS Manager](https://manager.rns.rifos.org/)

> Note that registering a username is a 2-step process, you will need the RIF token to perform both transactions. First step involves requesting a username and the second step involves purchasing the username.

To register a username, follow the steps below;

**Step 1: Open the RIF Wallet App**

Open the RIF Wallet application, and click on the “No username” at the top left corner. 

> Ensure the RIF token is selected as shown in the image below. To register a .rsk username, you need some RIF tokens in your wallet. See section on [Funding Your Wallet](/rif/wallet/user-guide/funding-a-wallet/) for ways on how to fund your wallet with the RIF Token.
