The RIF wallet is a smart contract, hence it needs to be deployed to the blockchain to enable transfer of funds and interaction with other decentralized apps. See [FAQs](/rif/wallet/faqs/) section on why deployment is needed.

> **Note that initial deployment of the wallet is **FREE** for end users and has been subsidized by IOV Labs. The wallet cannot be redeployed after deployment.**

**Step 1: Click on the Settings icon**

On the wallet homepage, click on the settings icon at the top right corner, and click on “Deploy a wallet”.

**Step 5: Deployment successful**

Once done, you should see a message saying “Your smart contract has been deployed!” with  a hash, you can use this hash to check the details of the deployment transaction on the [Rootstock explorer](https://rootstock.blockscout.com/).You should also check if your wallet is deployed under the accounts section in settings.
