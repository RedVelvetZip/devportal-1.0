When you create transactions, you might want to view the transaction history and the status of the transaction at a later date. 

There are two ways you can view your transaction history on the RIF Wallet;

#### Viewing recent transactions using the home screen

On the home screen, you should see a list of recent transactions.

> To find a comprehensive list of transactions, see section on Viewing a transaction using the transactions page.

#### Understanding the transaction status

**Pending** transactions refers to a transaction still in progress and going through confirmations. 

A transaction with status **confirmed** indicates that the transaction has been confirmed on the blockchain. Note that a confirmed transaction **cannot be reversed**. Ensure that all details of the transaction have been reviewed before sending.
