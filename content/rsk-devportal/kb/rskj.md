**RSKj** is the software used to run nodes on the Rootstock network.

You can run
[RSKj](/rsk/node/) locally to connect to the public Rootstock networks -
[RSK Mainnet](https://explorer.rsk.co/), and the
[RSK Testnet](https://explorer.testnet.rsk.co/).
This is an alternative to using the [RPC API](/tools/rpc-api/).

RSKj can also run in a “localhost”-only environment, without connecting to any public network - [Rootstock Regtest](/rsk/node/configure/switch-network/#regtest)

> The `--import` feature can be used to import the block database from an external source. See example for [using the import feature](/kb/rskj-for-developers/#import). This is to be used ONLY for testing and development purposes and not in production.

If you do one of the following activities, you are likely to need to run RSKj on your computer.

- Development <!-- → /kb/rskj-for-developers TODO add link -->
- Running nodes <!-- → /kb/rskj-for-node-runners  TODO add link -->
- Mining <!-- → /kb/rskj-for-miners TODO add link -->

If none of the above applies to you, it is quite likely that you do not need to run RSKj software on your computer.
