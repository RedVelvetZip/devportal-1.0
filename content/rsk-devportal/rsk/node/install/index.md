Rootstock nodes can be installed on Ubuntu OS, Windows, Docker and Java. Here, we provide step-by-step instructions for all supported dev environments. Depending on your network performance, it usually takes 10 to 15 mins to setup a working node on Mainnet.

> Ensure that your system meets the [minimum requirements](/rsk/node/install/requirements/) before installing the Rootstock nodes on it.
