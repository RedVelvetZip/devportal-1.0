Compile and run your own node, step by step:

- From [command line](/rsk/node/contribute/cli)
- Using IntelliJ IDEA:
  - [On Windows](/rsk/node/contribute/windows)
  - [On Linux](/rsk/node/contribute/linux)
  - [On Mac](/rsk/node/contribute/macos)

> **Important Notice: [RSKj HOP v4.2.0](https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/releases/) now supports ARM CPUs on Linux OS. See [using RocksDB](/rsk/node/configure/#using-rocksdb)**.

After the previous steps have been completed, you can try these tutorials:
