Rootstock is the Smart Contract platform of Bitcoin. Its engine is a forked version of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), and the RVM (Rootstock Virtual Machine) is compatible with Ethereum [Smart Contracts](/kb/ethereum-dapp-to-rsk/) and the [tools](/tools/) used to [deploy and interact](/kb/) with them.

The [Smart Bitcoin (RBTC)](/rsk/rbtc/) is the native currency in Rootstock and it is used to pay for the gas required for the execution of transactions. It is pegged 1:1 with Bitcoin, which means in Rootstock there are exactly 21M RBTC. A [Powpeg](/rsk/architecture/powpeg/) allows the [transfer of bitcoins](/rsk/rbtc/conversion/) from the Bitcoin blockchain to the Rootstock blockchain and vice-versa.

To learn more about Rootstock architecture, please refer to the [Original](https://rootstock.io/static/163f032d63d561e4c2fd7befe01d3e4e/rsk_white_paper-original.pdf) or [Updated](https://rootstock.io/static/a79b27d4889409602174df4710102056/RS-whitepaper.pdf) Rootstock whitepapers.

Rootstock has two networks, one is a development or testing network (also known as Testnet), and the other a production network (Mainnet), with blocks every 30 seconds.

To interact with the network, you need access to a node. The following are the available options:
- [RPC API](/tools/rpc-api/)
- [Install node](/rsk/node/install)
- [Compile the node code](/rsk/node/contribute/)
- [Powpeg HSM Firmware Attestation](/rsk/architecture/powpeg#powpeg-hsm-firmware-attestation)
