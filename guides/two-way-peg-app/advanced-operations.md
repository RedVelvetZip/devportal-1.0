This section contains detailed instructions on how to perform advanced operations on the 2 way peg app including how to [select different accounts](#account-selection), [adjusting network fees](#adjusting-network-fees), et cetera.

## Account selection

There are three types of accounts on the 2 way peg app. See [supported addresses](/guides/two-way-peg-app/getting-started#supported-addresses) section for examples of these types of addresses.

To select an account to send BTC from, click on **Select the account** as shown in the image below. This loads the balance for all the addresses in your hardware wallet.

> Note: Your hardware wallet must be connected to view this section of the 2 way peg app.

### Advanced data

**Unsigned raw tx**

A Bitcoin raw transaction is a chunk of bytes that contains the info about a Bitcoin transaction. That raw transaction will become part of the blockchain when a miner adds it to a block. The pegin transaction has at least one input and two outputs, all information is encoded and displayed for the users’ verification.

## Adjusting network fees

There are three options to choose from when deciding on which fee rate to use when sending a transaction.

**Slow**

A slow transaction is less expensive and will take longer to confirm.

**Average**

This is also known as normal, here, the transaction is priced at an average rate and will take an average time to confirm.

**Fast**

A fast transaction is the most expensive but the transaction confirms at the quickest time possible.

> The type of fee to be selected depends on several variables, like network speed, time, and amount the user is willing to spend on a single transaction.
